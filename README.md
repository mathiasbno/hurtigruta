## Assignment

This is my solution to the Hurtigruta tech test.

In the commits you'll find the answers to the 4 assignments as a progression of the search filed task.

For the last task adding some sort of timeout tracking keyinputs and only running the search when
there had been a break in keypresses. But with the current API beeing so fast its no point in
limiting the search calls.

## To run

To run the app:

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

To run the API server:

```
$ npm run server
```
